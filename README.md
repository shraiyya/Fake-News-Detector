# Fake-News-Detector
Fake news Detection using TfidfVectorizer
- The fake news detector was made using *TfidfVectorizer*  and intializing the *Passive Agressive classiﬁer*.
- **TfidfVectorizer**-TfidfVectorizer - Transforms text to feature vectors that can be used as input to estimator. 
- **Passive Agressive classiﬁer**-The passive-aggressive algorithms are a family of algorithms for large-scale learning.
- The libaries used are :
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit Learn
  - Itertools
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- The accuracy was predicted taking different values of max_iter and confusion matrix was plotted. Accuracy  is the number of correct   predictions made divided by the total number of predictions made, multiplied by 100 to turn it into a percentage.The confusion matrix  summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm.
